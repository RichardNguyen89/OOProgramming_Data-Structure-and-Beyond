# OOProgramming_Data-Structure-and-Beyond
The course is offered by UCSD on Coursera. It introduces arrays, lists, regex, dictionary, hash map, set, graph, performance analysis. Introduction to recursion, sort, search and graph algorithms.

The final project is the Social Network folder. This final project implements DFS, Strong Connected Components and Graph algorithms to explore 2 questions:
1. Given a list of users and their friends, return some users who have connection to the user but not yet on their friendlist. In short, a friend recommendation system based on connection.
2. Given a graph of users built from friendship, identify communities based on betweeness (the weight of a connection/edge that is defined by how many times the edge is presented in a shortest path from any user/vertex to another user/vertex).
